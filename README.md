## Overview

üë©üèª‚Äçüíª [Frontend Mentor](www.frontendmentor.io) challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

‚ö° This challenge had the aim of working on CSS layout skills by using grid and/or flexbox to build a responsive social proof section.

üöÄ I built this using HTML and CSS, with the help of [Figma](https://www.figma.com) for the design. I mostly used flexbox for this, with grid just for the desktop body layout. I found it very helpful for practicing my flexbox skills in learning how to apply the align-self property, as opposed to individually offsetting the position of elements! This definitely made it easier and quicker to modify for the mobile design. I know I could improve the accessibility with better sectioning of the elements, instead of all divs.

### Challenge Requirements

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the section depending on their device's screen size
